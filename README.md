# ChessBot
This repository contains a Python-based reinforcement learning project focused on developing a chess-playing AI. The project uses object-oriented programming principles to represent the chess board and pieces, and implements a custom rule-checking system to validate moves. The AI uses reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal strategies.
